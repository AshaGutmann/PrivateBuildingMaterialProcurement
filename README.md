# Private Building Material Procurement Platform

A revolutionary blockchain-based platform that leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to enable confidential procurement of building materials while maintaining complete privacy throughout the supply chain management process.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Concepts

### FHE-Powered Confidential Building Material Procurement
This platform transforms traditional building material procurement by implementing cutting-edge Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology. The system enables secure, private transactions where sensitive procurement data remains encrypted throughout the entire process, from initial requirements to final delivery.

### Privacy-First Building Supply Chain Management
Our innovative approach ensures that all stakeholder information, pricing details, quality specifications, and delivery schedules remain completely confidential while still enabling transparent and verifiable transactions on the blockchain.

## üîê Key Features
